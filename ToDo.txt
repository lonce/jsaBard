Need to know the file name (should have drop down slector like jsaSound does

Document "How To"
   shift->Set to store settings
   Set - to send them to the synth


   In authoring tool, sound file names are too long for the display.

   Need drop-down box for selecting sounds
   	(This will also save the ungraceful way unfound jsaSound model files are handled)
   	make it so no need to type .js at the end of file names

Should be able to name scenes for easy recall.

Insert scenes between pre-existing ones.
